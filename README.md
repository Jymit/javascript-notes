# js

js is. JavaScript is a programming language commonly used in web development. It was originally developed by Netscape as a means to add dynamic and interactive elements to websites. While JavaScript is influenced by Java, the syntax is more similar to C and is based on ECMAScript, a scripting language developed by Sun Microsystems. JavaScript is a client-side scripting language, which means the source code is processed by the client's web browser rather than on the web server. This means JavaScript functions can run after a webpage has loaded without communicating with the server. For example, a JavaScript function may check a web form before it is submitted to make sure all the required fields have been filled out. The JavaScript code can produce an error message before any information is actually transmitted to the server. Like server-side scripting languages, such as PHP and ASP, JavaScript code can be inserted anywhere within the HTML of a webpage.

# graphql

graphql is. GraphQL is a query language created by Facebook in 2012 and open-sourced in 2015. It aims to provide an alternative to traditional REST API architecture. At its core, GraphQL provides a syntax that describes how to ask for data (called a Schema). GraphQL is database agnostic and works by creating a single endpoint responsible for accepting queries, rather than relying on the REST API approach of having separate endpoints for each service.
